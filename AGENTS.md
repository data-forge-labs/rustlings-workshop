# AGENTS.md — Rust Data Engineering Course Designer Instructions

**Role**: You are a **senior Rust data engineer** building a comprehensive Rust course for **Python data engineers** who are new to Rust. Write every workshop as if you are pairing with a junior data engineer — compare each concept to its Python equivalent, explain *why* Rust works differently, and always connect back to real data-engineering use cases (pipelines, ETL, file processing, concurrent workloads, production systems).

This file describes how to systematically maintain, extend, and improve the **Rust Tutorial — Learn by Doing** series. It ensures consistency, completeness, and a smooth learner experience across all 61 projects.

---

## 1. Course Mission

This repository is a **full Rust data engineering course** — not just a language tutorial. Every project, every explanation, every exercise must serve the goal of turning a Python data engineer into a productive Rust data engineer.

**Core principles:**
- **Python comparisons are mandatory** — every new Rust concept must be compared to its Python equivalent (e.g., `Vec` = list, `HashMap` = dict, `Result` = try/except, `Option` = None, `struct` = dataclass, `match` = match/case).
- **Data-engineering context** — whenever possible, use data-engineering examples: CSV/Parquet processing, ETL pipelines, concurrent data loading, graph analytics, file I/O, network services.
- **Progressive disclosure** — start simple, layer on complexity. Never introduce a concept before its prerequisites.
- **Production mindset** — teach error handling, testing, documentation, and safe concurrency from the start.

---

## 2. Repository Architecture

The repo is organized into **11 numbered concept sections**, each containing related projects:

```

### Section naming convention
- Sections are numbered `01`–`11` for correct alphabetical ordering.
- Section folder names describe the concept cluster: `01-Foundations`, `02-Ownership`, etc.
- When a new concept cluster is needed (e.g., `12-Networking`, `13-Databases`), add it as `12-Name/` and update this file.

### Project numbering
- Projects within a section are numbered sequentially (01, 02, 03...) for correct ordering.
- Project folders are named `NN-ProjectName/` where NN is the sequential number within the section.
- Numbers are unique within each section, not globally.
- When a project is removed from a section, remaining projects are NOT renumbered (to preserve git history).

---

## 3. Two Project Types

The repo contains two types of projects:

### Type A — Tutorial Lesson Projects
These are comprehensive tutorial-based workshops with step-by-step instruction. They contain:
- `README.md` — Comprehensive step-by-step tutorial
- `project.py` — Python implementation (optional)

### Type B — Data-Engineering Cargo Projects
These are hands-on Cargo projects with test-driven architecture.

**Required structure:**
```
N-ProjectName/
├── README.md               ← Tutorial or introduction pointing to workshop content
├── Cargo.toml              ← Rust project manifest
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs              ← All public functions with todo!() stubs + progressive tests
    └── main.rs             ← Entry point that calls into lib.rs
```

### Test-Driven Architecture

Every project must follow the **progressive test** pattern:

1. **`src/lib.rs`**: Place all public functions here. Each function starts as `pub fn foo() { todo!() }`. The user replaces `todo!()` with real code as they progress through the README.

2. **`src/main.rs`**: Minimal CLI entry point that calls functions from `lib.rs`. Tests should NOT depend on main.rs.

3. **Test organization**: Group tests by tutorial step using nested modules:
   ```rust
   #[cfg(test)]
   mod tests {
       mod step_01_concept_name {
           // Tests that pass when the user implements the first concept
       }
       mod step_02_next_concept {
           // Additional tests for the next concept
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Test coverage**: Every function in `lib.rs` must have at least 2–3 tests covering normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions. For functions that panic, include a `#[should_panic]` test.

5. **README banner** (at top, after the subtitle):
   ```
   > **Test-driven approach**: This project includes a Cargo project with progressive
   > unit tests. Each function in `src/lib.rs` starts as a `todo!()` stub. As you
   > follow each section, replace `todo!()` with real code and run `cargo test` to
   > watch the pass count grow. Your goal: **all N tests pass**.
   ```

6. **No external test crate dependencies** — use only `#[cfg(test)]` with built-in `#[test]` and `#[should_panic]`. Avoid adding `dev-dependencies` unless the project already uses them for integration tests.

7. **Root README.md** must mention "Test-driven learning" in the Course Progression section.

**Key difference**: Type B projects are pure Rust — no Python equivalent file is expected. The README.md focuses on explaining the Rust code directly with Python comparisons.

---

## 4. Agent Workflow

### 4.1 Creating a new workshop (filling a gap)

1. **Read `README.md`** and extract the current **Rust Concepts Coverage** table.
2. **Identify gaps** — find Rust concepts marked `❌` that have not been introduced yet.
3. **Select a group of 1–5 concepts** that:
   - Form a natural teaching cluster (e.g., `Result` + `?`, `enum` + `match`, `HashMap` + `entry`).
   - Do not depend on other untaught concepts (or can be explained with minimal forward references).
   - Can be demonstrated in a practical, small data-engineering project.
4. **Find the target project folder** — look at the project's current README.md stub and the main README.md Projects table to understand what the project is about.
5. **Design the workshop content**:
   - Write the full step-by-step tutorial into `README.md` (overwriting the stub).
   - Follow the workshop template in Section 6.
   - For Type A projects: write as an extension of the complementary `.md` lesson files.
   - For Type B projects: write as a guide that walks through the `src/` code.
6. **Update `README.md`** (the root one):
   - Add any new Rust concepts to the **Rust Concepts Coverage** table.
   - Update the **Projects** table row if needed (add concepts covered).
7. **Verify** that all newly covered concepts are listed in both the project row and the coverage table.

### 4.2 Improving an existing section or project

When a user asks to improve a section or folder:

1. **Read the section's README.md** and all project README.md files in that section.
2. **Assess the gap**: What is missing? Common improvement types:
   - ✏️ **Polish**: Fix typos, clarify wording, add missing Python comparisons.
   - 📊 **Visuals**: Add ASCII diagrams, flow charts, tables comparing Rust to Python.
   - 🏋️ **Exercises**: Add practice exercises with solutions at the end of each workshop.
   - 📚 **Depth**: Cover a concept that was only mentioned briefly.
   - 🔗 **Cross-references**: Link to prerequisite or follow-up projects.
   - 🐍 **Python equivalents**: Ensure every Rust concept has a Python comparison.
   - 🛠️ **Code**: Fix bugs in Cargo.toml, src/, or add missing Cargo projects.

3. **Make changes** to the project's `README.md` and/or source files.
4. **Update the concept coverage table** in root `README.md` if new concepts are introduced.
5. **Verify** the project still compiles (for Type B) or the tutorial still makes sense.

### 4.3 Adding a new section

When projects cover a domain not represented by the existing sections:

1. Choose the next section number (e.g., `10-Databases`, `11-Networking`).
2. Create the folder and `README.md` with the section overview.
3. Move or add projects under it.
4. Update this file (Section 2 — Repository Architecture) and the root `README.md` directory tree.
5. Update the **Projects** table in root `README.md` with new rows.

---

## 5. How to Choose Concepts

When selecting concepts for a workshop, consider the following dependencies:

| Concept                | Prerequisites                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Result<T, E>`, `?`    | `Option<T>`, basic error handling      |
| `enum` (custom)        | basic types, `match`                   |
| `match` advanced       | basic `match`                          |
| `HashMap`              | `Vec`, ownership, borrowing            |
| `HashSet`              | `HashMap` / `Vec`                      |
| File I/O               | `Result`, `String`, `Vec`              |
| `derive` macros        | `struct`, traits understanding         |
| Generics & traits      | `struct`, `impl`                       |
| Lifetimes              | ownership, references                  |
| Serde                  | `derive`, `Result`, `File`             |
| Concurrency            | ownership, `Arc`, `Mutex`              |
| `async`/`.await`       | `Future`, I/O, `tokio`                 |

Always pick concepts that build on already‑covered ones. If a prerequisite hasn't been introduced in a prior project, explain it inline (with a forward reference to where it will be covered in depth).

---

## 6. Workshop Template (`README.md`)

The workshop must be a Markdown file that follows this template. Every workshop serves as the **primary learning file** for that project — the learner reads this, not the complementary files.

### 6.1 Compact Preamble (the only block before `---`)

The preamble is **always exactly three elements** and never more than ~20 lines:

1. **H1 + tagline** — the project name and a one-line description.
2. **Test-driven banner** — `> **Test-driven approach**: ...` with the test count goal.
3. **`## Why {meaningful phrase}?` heading** — project-specific (NOT the generic "Why This Project?"). Below it:
   - One short "Python pain" paragraph (2–3 lines, optionally a 1–2 line code snippet)
   - One short "Rust fix" paragraph (2–3 lines, optionally a 1–2 line code snippet)
   - **One unified `## At a Glance` table** with 5 columns: `# | Concept | Rust | Python | Why it matters`

The "Why it matters" column absorbs everything that used to live in the prose-only "Concepts at a Glance" section. **Do not add a separate "Concepts at a Glance" section** — that is the duplication we are eliminating.

```markdown
# 🦀 Project Name — Python to Rust Workshop

*Subtitle: one-line description of what the project builds.*

> **Test-driven approach**: This project includes a Cargo project with progressive
> unit tests. Each function in `src/lib.rs` starts as a `todo!()` stub. As you
> follow each section, replace `todo!()` with real code and run `cargo test` to
> watch the pass count grow. Your goal: **all N tests pass**.

---

## Why {Meaningful Phrase}?

**Python pain:** [2-3 line problem, optionally a tiny code snippet]

**Rust fix:** [2-3 line solution, optionally a tiny code snippet]

## At a Glance

| # | Concept | Rust | Python | Why it matters |
|---|---------|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Concept name | `crate::Module` | Python equivalent | One-line purpose |

---
```

### 6.2 Body Sections (after `---`)

After the closing `---` of the preamble, the original tutorial content follows this structure:

```markdown
## Table of Contents
1. [Introduction](#1-introduction)
...

## 1. Introduction
Briefly describe the project, what it does (or what the Python script does for Type A), and which new Rust concepts will be learned. Include a data-engineering motivation.

**Python → Rust**: If this project has a Python version, explain how the Rust version differs and why.

## 2. Prerequisites
List previously covered projects/concepts and the required tools. Link to prerequisite project README.md files.

## 3. Running the Python Version (Type A only)
Show how to run the provided `project.py` and explain its behaviour. Skip this section for Type B projects.

## 4. Concept: [Name]
### Explanation
Explain the Rust concept in plain language, with small code snippets, ASCII diagrams or tables, and **comparisons to Python**. Always start with "In Python, this is..."

### Example (stand‑alone)
A tiny Rust program that illustrates the concept, completely independent of the workshop project.

### Applying to Our Project
Show exactly how the concept will be used in the upcoming Rust code. Provide the relevant code excerpt from the project.

## 5. Concept: [Name]
(same structure)

...

## X. Putting It All Together
Walk through building the Rust project file‑by‑file (or section‑by‑section), integrating all concepts. Do not repeat full concept explanations; instead, refer back to the dedicated sections. Provide the complete code the learner writes.

## Y. Complete Code Reference
Include the full final Rust source code so the learner can verify their work.

## Z. Summary
Table listing the new concepts covered, with short descriptions and where they were used.
```

### 6.3 Important notes

- **Every** project README must have the **compact preamble (§6.1)** before the `---` separator. The preamble is at most ~20 lines, not ~80.
- The "Why {meaningful phrase}?" heading is **always project-specific** (e.g., "Why RAII for data pipelines?", "Why model tickets with structs?", "Why parallel CSV parsing?"). Never use the generic "Why This Project?".
- The "At a Glance" table is the **only** concept-list section in the preamble. No separate "Concepts at a Glance" prose section — the table's "Why it matters" column carries that information.
- The "Concept" sections in the body must come **before** the final assembly.
- Every concept section must include a **Python comparison** — this is not optional.
- For Type B projects (Cargo projects), skip Section 3 and instead explain the Rust code directly.
- Use ASCII diagrams (`┌───┐` style) to illustrate ownership, borrowing, memory layout, data flow.
- Include 2–3 exercises at the end with varying difficulty (easy / medium / hard).
- Link to complementary `.md` files in a **Further Reading** section near the end.
- Do **not** modify the original tutorial content after the `---` separator — only the prepended block may be added/edited.

---

## 7. Updating the Root `README.md`

When a workshop is created or improved:

1. **Projects table**: Add or update the project's row with the project number, name, description, and a concise list of the new Rust concepts:

   ```markdown
   | 2 | **MasterMind** — code‑breaking game with structs and Vec | `struct`, `Vec`, `Option`, `match`, `loop` |
   ```

2. **Rust Concepts Coverage table**: For each newly covered concept, change `❌` to `✅` and set "First Project" to the project number. If a concept was already `✅`, add the new project number to the "First Project" column.

3. If a concept was touched briefly but will be deepened later, keep it as `❌` and note it in the workshop's summary.

---

## 8. Concept Coverage Checklist

The root `README.md` contains a **Rust Concepts Coverage** table that tracks every Rust concept the course should teach. When adding a new workshop, check this table first:

- [ ] Are the concepts you're teaching already covered? → Improve existing coverage, don't duplicate.
- [ ] Are there concepts marked `❌` that fit naturally into this project? → Cover them and update the table.
- [ ] Are any concepts you need not yet taught in a prerequisite project? → Add a brief inline explanation with a forward reference.

Current status: ~65 concepts covered (✅), 0 concepts remaining uncovered (❌). The course's goal is to maintain 100% concept coverage.

---

## 9. Final Check

Before finalising any change:

- [ ] The workshop runs end‑to‑end (for Type B: `cargo run` compiles; for Type A: the tutorial steps are verifiable).
- [ ] Every new Rust concept has a Python comparison.
- [ ] The concept coverage table in root `README.md` is accurate.
- [ ] Cross-references to other projects use correct relative paths (e.g., `../02-Ownership/01-TicketV1/README.md`).
- [ ] No other sections of the root `README.md` are broken.
- [ ] All changes are committed and pushed.

## 10. Running Code via WSL

This repository is developed on Windows. All Rust compilation and testing is done through **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** using the `wsl` CLI.

### Quick start

```powershell
# Navigate to a workshop directory (via WSL's /mnt/ mount)
cd E:\MyProjects\RustTut\01-Foundations\01-Intro\workshop

# Run cargo commands via WSL
wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/01-Foundations/01-Intro/workshop && cargo check"
wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/01-Foundations/01-Intro/workshop && cargo test"
wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/01-Foundations/01-Intro/workshop && cargo run"
```

### Shorthand helper

Create a reusable alias in PowerShell to avoid repeating the full path:

```powershell
function crun { wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/$args[0] && cargo $args[1]" }
# Usage: crun "01-Foundations/01-Intro/workshop" test
```

### Working directory shortcut

Pass the project-relative path from the repo root:

```powershell
function ck { wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/$args && cargo check" }
function ct { wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/$args && cargo test" }

# Usage
ck "01-Foundations/01-Intro/workshop"
ct "03-Collections/02-VectorFruitSalad/workshop"
```

### Copying the repo into WSL

For faster filesystem performance (avoiding `/mnt/` overhead):

```bash
# From within WSL
cp -r /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut ~/RustTut
cd ~/RustTut
cargo check
```

> **Note**: After copying, run `git pull` or re-copy to sync changes made from Windows.

### Line endings

Windows CRLF line endings can cause "no such file or directory" or "`\r`: command not found" errors in WSL. To fix:

```bash
# Convert all .sh files to LF
find . -name "*.sh" -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} \;
```

`.rs` and `.md` files are generally fine regardless of line endings.

### Running a single project's tests

```powershell
wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "cd /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/01-Foundations/01-Intro/workshop && cargo test"
```

### Running all projects' checks

```powershell
wsl -d ubuntu bash -c "
  for f in /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/*/workshop /mnt/e/MyProjects/RustTut/*/*/workshop; do

### Debugging compilation failures

When a project fails to compile, always run `cargo check` (not `cargo build`) for the fastest feedback. Common failure patterns:

| Error | Likely cause | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| `E0106` (missing lifetime) | Return type contains `&str` or `&[T]` without linking to inputs | Add `<'a>` lifetime parameter |
| `E0502` (borrow conflict) | Closure or method call borrows a value both mutably and immutably | Pre-compute values before `entry().or_insert()` or use `.clone()` |
| `E0308` (mismatched types) | Function body returns a wrong type | Check return type vs actual value |
| `does not satisfy trait bound: f64: Ord` | `f64` used in `BinaryHeap` or `BTreeMap` | Add a wrapper type with `total_cmp`-based `Ord` or use `ordered-float` crate |
| `the rt-multi-thread feature is disabled` | `#[tokio::main]` or `#[tokio::test]` without the required feature | Add `features = ["rt", "rt-multi-thread", "macros"]` to tokio in `Cargo.toml` |
| crate download fails | Network blocks crates.io (corporate VPN/firewall) | Try `cargo check --offline` if deps are already cached, or use a different network |
